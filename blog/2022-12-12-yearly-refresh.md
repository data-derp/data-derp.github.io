We are starting to refresh the content with all the feedback we've received this year.
The main themes for this end of year revamp are:

- Slimming down content.
- Adding expected durations.
- Marking optional content more prominently so participants don't go down unexpected rabbit holes.
- New project spanning Data Integration, Transformation, Visualisation, and Streaming.
- End of term wrap up activity giving participants a chance to practice and show off what they have learned.
- Internal administrative improvements (e.g. feedback collection, Gather layout, scheduling improvements for guided tours)

Our goal is to shape an even better course for beginners in the data space.

Stay tuned!
