# Tables

## Keeping it simple

* Try to keep your tables as simple as possible.
* The most simple table should have one row or column header.
* If the data itself is complex, think about whether it’s possible to split it into multiple tables. This might also increase accessibility on mobile devices.

### Use semantic HTML

* If you’re publishing your tables on the web, use semantic markup for creating your tables.
* **Good:** Using `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>,` and other table markup to present tabular data.
* **Bad:** Using non-semantic HTML like `<div>` instead, just styling it like a table.
