# Exercise: Query your Data
We [previously talked a little bit about Query Engines](../data-engineering-the-good-parts/03-data-milky-way-brief-history-part-2-evolution.mdx#cloud-revolution). Query Engines  allow us to query our Data Lakes / unstructured data. There are many Query Engines currently in the market (at the time of writing) including AWS Athena, Presto, Trino, Dremio, Databricks SQL. 

For this exercise, we'll jump into Databricks SQL to view, explore, and query our data. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/data-derp/exercise-ev-databricks/tree/main/view-data-in-dbx-sql) to get started!
