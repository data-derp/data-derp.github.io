# Exercise: Create a Workflow
Quite often, when transforming data, there are several stages of transformation, which when run one after another form what we call a "Data Pipeline" or a "Workflow". For example, a Workflow can start with an ingestion job, then feature several transformations that can fan-out and then fan-in. These Workflows can become rather complex in nature, and it leaves room for human error when individual steps are triggered manually or variability in a large team. In order to encourage reproducibility, it is encouraged to use a Workflow or Data Pipelining tool, in which individual jobs and its properties (like dependencies from which to trigger) are defined. These dependencies are often represented by a [DAG (Directed acyclic graph)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph). There are a variety of Workflow/Data Pipelining tools that exist such as [Dagster](https://dagster.io/), [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/), and other Platform- or Cloud-native offerings.

Coming back to our existing Batch use case, workflows for Batch Transformations are often started with a manual trigger or automatically in response to an event or cron schedule. In this exercise, we will create a Workflow in Databricks to trigger first our Bronze transformation, and upon success, trigger the Silver transformation logic.

1. In the left-navigation window in Databricks, open **Workflows**

2. Next, click **Create Job**

3. Enter a name for the task that will run your Bronze logic and choose the type **Notebook**.

    Note that there are a variety of logic types to choose from aside from **Notebook**. In more production settings, we might opt to package our logic in a jar or Python Wheel. In this case, we're using the logic created in Notebooks in earlier exercises.

4. Next, for the **Path** field, choose the **Batch Processing - Bronze** Notebook from your Workspace:

5. For the **Cluster** field, choose your Cluster. Click **Save**.

6. Click the big **+** button to create your next task (for the Silver logic) and select Notebook

    ![click-big-x.png](./assets/click-big-x.png)

7. Repeat the same steps as earlier but name this task uniquely (to represent the Silver logic). Note that there is now a dependency on the Bronze task. Click **Create Task**

8. Click the big **+** button to create your next task (for the Gold logic) and select Notebook

   ![click-big-x.png](./assets/click-big-x.png)

9. Repeat the same steps as earlier but name this task uniquely (to represent the Gold logic). Note that there is now a dependency on the Silver task. Click **Create Task**

   ![create-gold-task.png](./assets/create-gold-task.png)

10. Click the **Runs** tab at the top left and click "Run now" to trigger your job. If your cluster is not already running, it probably will take a while.

11. Success!

## Reflect
### What are some drawbacks of our notebooks that might affect pipeline processing time?
Our notebooks deliberately and by design contain tests to enhance the learning experience. In a production setting, the functions that have been written might be pulled out to a single file and packaged into a jar or Python wheel without the tests.


### How can I avoid using the UI to create these Workflow tasks?
Databricks jobs can be [written in declarative form through tools like Terraform](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/12/5/databricks-workflows-through-terraform.html).
