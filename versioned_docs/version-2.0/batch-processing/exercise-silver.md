# Exercise: Silver
In the last exercise, we ingested our data. In this exercise, we'll take our first step towards curation and cleanup by:
* Unpacking strings containing json to JSON
* Flattening our data (unpack nested structures and bring to top level)
* Casting ambiguous columns to types

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/data-derp/exercise-ev-databricks/tree/main/batch-processing-silver) to get started!
