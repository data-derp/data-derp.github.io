## Let's Be Pragmatic
Rather than obsessing over this ETL vs ELT cage fight, just try to take away the following:
* Sometimes you may want to optimize/reshape your data sooner (because you know that’s how everyone wants to use it)
* Other times, you want to leave the schema flexible (and just let the user’s queries/views do the work) to avoid having to maintain lots of tables/views/jobs
