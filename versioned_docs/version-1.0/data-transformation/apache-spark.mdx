# Apache Spark

## Introduction to Spark
* [Video from DataBricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4PkA2huzVc)
  * First 3 minutes at least, can skim the rest
* [slides](https://brookewenig.com/SparkOverview.html#/) from Brooke Wenig
* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud6luYCkkMk&ab_channel=DustinVannoy) from Dustin Vannoy

## Reflect
* Understand the difference between Transformations (lazy evaluation) and Actions
* Understand the difference between Driver and Worker nodes

## Useful Links
* [Spark SQL Programming Guide (Python or Scala recommended)](http://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.1/sql-getting-started.html)
* [DataFrame Methods](http://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.1/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql.html#dataframe-apis) - e.g. df.someMethod()
* [Column Methods](http://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.1/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql.html#column-apis) - e.g. F.col("myField").someMethod()

* [The Sacred Texts](http://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.1/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql.html#functions) - pyspark.sql.functions
* [Windows](http://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.1/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql.html#window) - you’re going to want to read this carefully 😉
* [Campus PySpark & AWS + Spark Architectures](https://www.udemy.com/course/pyspark-aws-master-big-data-with-pyspark-and-aws/) (optional, when you have time)

## Spark Cluster Topology
* [Overview](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/cluster-overview.html)

Working with a distributed system can be confusing to grasp. Here are the basic must-knows:
  * Very important that you understand the difference between driver and worker nodes 
  * Variables and data in your driver program are not automatically accessible/editable in your worker nodes 
  * You’ll either need to define those constants in your UDF (see Databricks exercises) or look at [broadcast/accumulator](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/rdd-programming-guide.html#broadcast-variables) variables
