# Data Milky Way: Distributed Data Systems (NoSQL & CAP)
We talked a little about NoSQL earlier. Let's just skim the surface and talk about some important concepts driving it.

## NoSQL Technologies

**Summary: Pick Two:**
* **C** (consistency)
* **A** (availability)
* **P** (partition tolerance)

But is it really true in the real world?
* What unrealistic assumption are we making here?
  * Can we really assume that network communications won’t fail?
  * Is there really such thing as a distributed system that won’t have partitions?
* In Reality: not a binary choice between C and A
* Several NoSQL solutions offer a tunable tradeoff between C and A

## Summary
a CP system will say “sorry, I can’t be sure yet” to the client, in order to avoid giving an out-of-date answer

an AP system tries to spits out an answer even if it might not be the most up-to-date one
