Important comment upon Frank Kaneâ€™s video
  * Scala is only faster than Python if youâ€™re writing a lot of custom UDFs or data structures with RDDs.
  If youâ€™re using built-in Spark functions, then performance is **identical**
  * Most modern Spark users are shifting towards a Python codebase to take advantage of modern data science and machine learning tools - see next slides for empirical evidence ðŸ˜‰

Takeaways
  * What is the difference between Transformations (lazy evaluation) and Actions?
  * What is the difference between Driver and Worker nodes


[Spark SQL Programming Guide](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-getting-started.html) (Python or Scala recommended)

* Heading towards taking advantage of idiomatic Python with type hints
* Improving Python debugging is on the Databricks roadmap
* Thereâ€™s no denying the rich ecosystem of libraries, especially for advanced analytics & ML

## Are you a Pandaphile?
Try Databricks [Koalas](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
* PySpark but using Pandas syntax and APIs
* If youâ€™re interested, try it out and let us know what you think!
* However for the rest of this course, weâ€™ll teaching you the following APIs separately:
  * Spark DataFrames
  * Pandas
