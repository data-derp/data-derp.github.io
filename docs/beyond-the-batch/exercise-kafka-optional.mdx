# Exercise: Apache Kafka (Optional)
Apache Kafka can be deployed to both on-premise and cloud environments which makes it an interesting player in the enterprise data space. There are two exercises that you can explore:

* **Apache Kafka Tutorial** - play with Kafka locally on your computer using a docker image
* **Kafka on Confluent Cloud** - play with Kafka on Confluent Cloud. NOTE: might incur $$$ charges.

## Apache Kafka Tutorial
Follow the [official tutorial](http://kafka.apache.org/quickstart). To run this tutorial in a fresh environment, use this [this docker container](https://github.com/kelseymok/kafka-example).

## Kafka on Confluent Cloud
Follow the [instructions here](https://developer.confluent.io/quickstart/kafka-on-confluent-cloud) to get started. **NOTE:** this might incur charges, make sure that you tear down your cluster after the demo is finished.
