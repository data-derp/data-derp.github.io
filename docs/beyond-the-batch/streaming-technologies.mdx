# Driving Streaming in Production
We've talked a lot about the theoretics (and even walked through some exercises) of Spark Streaming in this section. You might recall that many of our examples involved writing input to netcat, from which our Streaming Application picked up data. In production settings, we'll need to leverage other tools such as Kafka or other Cloud-native streaming technologies that are both addressable and can scale with load. The next section (Bonus) gives an overview of these technologies.
