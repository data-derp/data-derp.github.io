## Foundational articles
For some background on where the idea was initially proposed, read the original article introducing the concept, 
[How to Move Beyond a Monolithic Data Lake to a Distributed Data Mesh](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html)
and the overview of the [Principles and Logical Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html)


## Webinars

As referenced in the Overview, Thoughtworks has produced a webinar, diving into each of the four principles in more depth, as well as covering learnings from applying
Data Mesh in practice. [The four principles of Data Mesh - Webinar Series](https://www.thoughtworks.com/about-us/events/webinars/core-principles-of-data-mesh). 
This is an excellent set of resources available to cover the current state of the Data Mesh.

Quite often, we get caught up about the tech implementation of a theory. The same follows for Data Mesh. Before we move on to talk about the technical concepts behind Data Mesh, we must stress that [it's not about tech, it's about ownership](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-in/insights/blog/data-mesh-its-not-about-tech-its-about-ownership-and-communication).
