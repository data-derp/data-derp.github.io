# Project Domain: EV Charging

## Background
In the time of climate change, the world is attempting to reduce its dependency on coal and gas (and thereby CO2 emissions) for energy by adopting green/renewable technologies. One of those technologies are Electric Vehicles (henceforth, "EVs" or "EV" [singular]). Governments have additionally announced bans on the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles, effective in the next 15 years in order to reduce CO2 emissions, putting pressure of automobile companies to invest in the betterment of EV-technology to make it more widespread and accessible. Logistics and large city public transportation fleets are also becoming electrified and charging technology is becoming more widespread and efficient, allowing for an even more larger spread of EVs. There are also a multitude of companies whose sole purpose is to coordinate the efforts of at-home Charger installations to make it even more convenient for the typical consumer, which also lays the groundwork for decentralised home energy management (leveraging bi-directional charging and home energy optimisers by way of home Photovoltalics and other energy generators). 

While the trend towards EVs seems optimistic, EVs aren't [yet] the hallmark of sustainability and socio-economic equality: battery technology largely still uses precious minerals whose method of acquisition are questionable, EVs are expensive thereby making them only available to those who are wealthy enough to afford both the vehicle and access to an at-home charging station, and EV charging networks are more prolific in cities whose living costs are already relatively expensive. There are continued efforts to improve both aspects (sustainability, socio-economic equality) and make it cheaper, more convenient, and accessible to the wider public which would even more reduce the dependency on oil and gas.

Charge Point Operators (CPOs), of which there are many, are responsible for installing Charge Points (Chargers) in strategic locations, maintaining security of the Charge Points, ensuring sufficient electricity flow and load management, managing reservations, handling bi-directional charging in compatible locations, and ensuring that charging an electric vehicle is a pleasant experience for the customer. There are four high-level components that a CPO might be concerned with in the space of Charge Management and optimisation:
1. the Charge Point that dispenses electricity which contains its own hardware and software
2. the Charging Station Management System (CSMS) with which the Charge Point communicates and interacts
3. the charging data generated by the Charge Point
4. intelligent solutions which offer cost-charging optimsations based on integrations with Photovolatics and real-time and historic data on electricty usage in the vicinity

The data collected by the CSMS is interesting for a variety of reasons. First, it offers drivers and fleet operators a view into their energy consumption and the ability to leverage scheduled/automated charging based on their own needs and charging patterns. Secondly, it offers some insight into charging behaviours which can feed into central electricity grids, allowing governments and electricity companies to better understand electricity consumption patterns and provide sufficient energy to these locations. Thirdly, as we slowly reduce our dependency on coal and gas, there could be interruptions of service from the elctricity grid if there are spikes of demand which the grid cannot quickly compensate but a network of plugged-in EVs in a community can quickly resolve in the locality through bi-directional charging back to the grid and decentralised at-home energy generators. In order for these use-cases to become realised,  Charge Point data must be treated as a first-class citizen.
