> **OLTP**
>
> Frequent updates, transactional behaviour/requirements
>
> Query priorities:
> * low-latency, up-to-date, consistent data for standard business operations

> **OLAP**
>
> Oriented towards analysis, modelling, reporting, business intelligence
>
> Query Priorities:
> * asking big questions against big data, supporting flexible queries/analyses
> * efficiently processing millions of rows and returning thousands/millions of rows

<summary>Why did people start moving from traditional databases and data warehouses to HDFS for Big Data Analytics in the mid 2000s?</summary>

Traditional relational databases and data warehouses relied on vertical scaling which required expensive/specialized hardware and was hard to plan for
HDFS and MapReduce allowed for horizontal scalability with cheap commodity hardware.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>And subsequently, why did people move from HDFS to Object Storage for Big Data Analytics?</summary>

Cloud-based Object Storage is super scalable and cheap, far more than HDFS (which is only often used in on-prem environments these days). It was also great for storing all sorts of file formats (unstructured text, images, video, etc.)
Most modern cloud-based Data Lakes are built-on Object Storage technologies.
Modern query engines such as Apache Spark, Presto, Dremio, etc. can efficiently scan data laying on object stores. To summarize:
object storage + (on-demand) query engines = fully decoupled storage and compute
(great for scalability, elasticity, cost)
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Name some object storage offerings from the 3 major cloud providers</summary>
<details>
    <summary>AWS</summary>
<ul>
<li>Amazon S3 (general purpose)</li>
<li>Amazon S3 Glacier (for archiving)</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Microsoft Azure</summary>
<ul>
<li>Azure Blob Storage (general purpose)</li>
<li>Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (has a file systems hierarchy, great for large structured and semi-structured datasets)</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>GCP</summary>
<ul>
<li>Google Cloud Storage or GCS (general purpose)</li>
</ul>
