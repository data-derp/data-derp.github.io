# Exercise: Gentle Introduction to Spark

For this exercise, we will work in Databricks. We'll be using Databricks because we can provide a narrative of the logic and walk through the logic together. It also makes learning the Spark API super easy!

[Follow these instructions for creating a Databricks Community Edition account](https://github.com/data-derp/exercise-co2-vs-temperature#data-ingestion) to get started.

Then follow instructions [here to import a notebook](https://github.com/data-derp/small-exercises/tree/master/gentle-introduction-to-spark).
