# Exercise: Gold
We've previously done some standardisation of our data, namely flattening and casting some columns to specific types, in the Silver exercise. In this exercise, we will take our beautifully standardised data and transform it using some business logic. Remember that wonderful Windows exercise? Get ready, because, **(cracks knuckles)** practice makes perfect!

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/data-derp/exercise-ev-databricks/tree/main/batch-processing-gold-2) to get started!
