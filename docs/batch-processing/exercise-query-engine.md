<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<figure class="video-container">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FWweHyUP8m8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
