# Exercise: Silver
In the last exercise, we took our data and partitioned them by YYYY, MM, DD, and HH. In this exercise, we'll take our first step towards curation and cleanup by:
* Unpacking strings containing json to JSON
* Flattening our data (unpack nested structures and bring to top level)
* Casting ambiguous columns to types

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/data-derp/exercise-ev-databricks/tree/main/batch-processing-silver) to get started!
