<summary>When first ingesting from a data source, why do you maintain a copy of the raw data as close to the original format as possible?</summary>
* You want to maintain your original source of truth in case of bugs/logic changes
* You don’t want to realize months down the line that you’ve accidentally been overwriting/tampering with the raw data and that it’s no longer irrecoverable!
* If (..or more like when) ever you want to fix/update your data transformation logic, it’s also good to have an optimized copy of your raw data (e.g. in Parquet vs plain text) so that your re-processing doesn’t take as long!
* It also helps to debug by breaking the steps into an ingestion step and transformation steps.
