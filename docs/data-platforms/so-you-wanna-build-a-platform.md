# So you wanna build a platform?

Platform thinking for data
business use cases
domains have very specific questions to be answered


Platforms offer curated data in that domain so that the data is cleaned up, the fields/columns are understandable/well-documented, it's transparent how the data was tranformed, and served to customers in a reasonable fashion (e.g. API, link to storage, streaming)... so that if there is someone who wants to find out more information about an object in a domain, they don't need to know the details of how to crunch that raw data to come to a conclusion (or to make a business decision). For example, the combination of signals that determine the on/off status of an object.

We start with our domain questions.

We'll solve the batch ones first.

how do we curate? -> landmarks of data processing.
