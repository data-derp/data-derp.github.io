# SQL: A Quick Review
When working with data, a solid knowledge of SQL is required to help think about your problem in terms of DataFrame transformations.

Have a quick scan through the topics that you're not too familiar with:
* [Joins](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp) and [Unions](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_union.asp)
* [Aggregate Functions (GROUP BY)](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_groupby.asp)
* [Window Functions](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-window-functions/)
* What’s so great about them anyways? (See next slide)
* [Indexes & Query Plans](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql/relational-queries-in-sql/a/more-efficient-sql-with-query-planning-and-optimization)

## A Deep Dive on Window Functions

* What limitations have you faced in your analytics when using GROUP BY in the past?
* How can you do rankings per each category efficiently?
* How can you get the entire row of the best-selling product? (imagine you want to see additional attributes of this product)

It is important to make sure you understand everything about window function semantics.

* partitionBy
    * similar to groupBy (but doesn’t reduce/aggregate information down to a single row)
* orderBy
    * Just FYI, you can orderBy(F.col(“myColumn”).desc()) for descending order.
* rowsBetween
    * You should look up the default arguments for different window functions (e.g. lag, lead, first, last, max, min, row_number)
* rangeBetween
  Can you explain the difference between rowsBetween and rangeBetween?

These are [all also concepts in SQL and not special to Spark](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-guide-to-advanced-sql-window-functions-f63f2642cbf9).
