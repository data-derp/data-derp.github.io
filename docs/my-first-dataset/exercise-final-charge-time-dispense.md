# Exercise: Final Charge Time and Charge Dispense for Completed Charges

| Question | Context |
| --- | --- |
| What is the final charge time and final charge dispense for every completed transaction? |  The MeterValues payload gives a cumulative reading of the charge that has been dispensed (measurand = "Energy.Active.Import.Register"). This also requires finding the start time of the transaction in question (transactional data not captured as part of the OCPP payloads). |

In this exercise, we'll answer the question: **What is the final charge time and final charge dispense for every completed transaction?**.
