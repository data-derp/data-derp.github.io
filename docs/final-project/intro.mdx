# You've come so far!

During class, you've probably been thinking about all the amazing things you could do with your newly acquired
knowledge. Now it's time to bring it all together and impress with vivid graphs that shows correlations.

## Instructions

1. Pick a dataset
   Here you may find some datasets:
    - https://dev.to/seattledataguy/5-data-sources-for-data-engineering-projects-3j21
    - https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets
    - https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/free-public-data-sets
    - https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory
    - https://ourworldindata.org (/world-population-growth)
    - https://open.esa.int
    - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
   You are free to use other sources of data, but do not spend too much time.

2. Write a five-sentence management-summary of the goals to achieve
   Cheating: We first look for data, and then we build a business case.
   Share your management-summary now with the team.

3. Decide if you want to batch or to stream the data. Ingest the data and clean them up properly.
4. Do analytics, build a dashboard, or automate a trigger to do something with the data, accord to your business goal.
5. Prepare an eight-minute presentation of your work and show it to the team.
   Include:
     - Repeat: The question you want to answer
     - Talk about the methods you've used in your code (why and how)
     - Show the outcome
     - Talk about the learnings you've made

For the final project you have the whole day. Note that this is not much time. Therefore, be well-structured
and do not take on too much. A complete walkthrough is more important than a nice detailed solution. Hint: Take
ten minutes to do a project plan first.
